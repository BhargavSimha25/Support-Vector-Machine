# Support Vector Machines (SVM) 🔍

Welcome to the **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to SVM, a powerful classification and regression technique in machine learning. SVMs are known for their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and their ability to handle non-linear decision boundaries.

## 📚 Overview

Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models that find the optimal hyperplane to separate data into different classes. This repository covers the fundamentals of SVM, its variants, and practical implementations to help you master this technique.
